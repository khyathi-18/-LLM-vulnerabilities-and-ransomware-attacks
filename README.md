# AI-Enhanced Defense for LLM-Orchestrated Ransomware

Shield 3.0 is an artificial intelligence-powered cybersecurity defense mechanism that identifies and prevents LLM-orchestrated ransomware attacks. According to research "Ransomware 3.0: Self-Composing and LLM-Orchestrated" (Raz et al., 2025), the project aims to counter autonomous ransomware that has the ability to plan and execute attacks independently without any human involvement.

The system leverages machine learning models trained against simulated datasets representing normal and malicious behavior to identify behavioral anomalies that indicate ransomware activity. The system includes real-time system monitoring, process and file activity feature extraction, automated anomaly detection, and a rollback feature that reverses files to a point of safety upon alert.

Shield 3.0 shows that temporal and behavior-based analysis can quite effectively supplement conventional signature-based antivirus techniques to give timely detection and response to adaptive, AI-powered threats. It is a prototype for next-generation smart defense architectures that will be able to deal with the next level of autonomous cyberattacks.

## Research Objectives

(RQ1) How can behavior patterns of LLM-orchestrated ransomware be identified at each stage of the attack lifecycle?

(RQ2) How can an AI-fueled defense system be architected to recognize ransomware activity using behavioral and temporal insights instead of static signatures?

(RQ3) How effective is the proposed model at detecting ransomware with high accuracy and low false positives in simulated environments?
## Methodology

#### Step 1: Data Generation
Created synthetic datasets representing benign and ransomware-like system activities (CPU, I/O, and file access metrics).

#### Step 2: Feature Extraction
Collected process-level and file-level behavioral features for temporal analysis.

#### Step 3: Model Training
Trained a Random Forest classifier to distinguish between normal and ransomware behaviors.

#### Step 4: Real-Time Monitoring
Developed a lightweight agent using psutil for live anomaly detection.

#### Step 5: Response & Recovery
Integrated automated rollback and isolation mechanisms to restore safe file states upon detection.
